Hash table based implementation of the Map interface. This implementation provides all of the optional map operations,
and permits null values and the null key. (The HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it is
unsynchronized and permits nulls.) This class makes no guarantees as to the order of the map; in particular, it does
not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time.
